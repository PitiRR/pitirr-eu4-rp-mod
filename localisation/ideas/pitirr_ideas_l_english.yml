  pontus_ideas_start:0 "Pontic Traditions"
  POE_black_sea_contender:0 "Contender of the Black Sea"
  POE_black_sea_contender_desc:0 "The waves of the Black Sea are our Empire's heartbeats, and Greek Fire is our fist. We have an established contact with the descendants of the greatest Greek naval engineers, and we shall use them to protect us from any hostilities from the sea."
  POE_phoenix_rises:0 "The Phoenix Rises"
  POE_phoenix_rises_desc:0 "Just like Phoenix rising from the ashes, the Pontic Empire arose once more with might the world has not seen. Pontic Greek peoples know what they fight for, and what the price of freedom is."
  POE_restore_forts:0 "Restore Pontic Fortifications"
  POE_restore_forts_desc:0 "The Pontic Mountains give us incredible defensive opportunities. As we control the entire mountain range, it would be very wise to establish a series of fortifications that work together like clockwork. Together, our castles are stronger than each of them individually."
  POE_byzantine_legacy:0 "Byzantine Legacy"
  POE_byzantine_legacy_desc:0 "Although we are among the greatest empires in the world right now, we must not forget our legacies or the past. Empire of Trebizond and our peoples have always been close to Constantinople. We are great on our own, but we thank the Western Greeks for their contributions. We shall let the world know this."
  POE_mother_of_nations:0 "Mother of Nations"
  POE_mother_of_nations_desc:0 "The history of Pontus begins with Darius the Great, as far as two thousand years ago. The peaks of the mountains have seen cultures come and go, and we acknowledge that. Asia Minor is home to many people, and they are all welcome as the subjects of the Empire."
  POE_greek_minorities:0 "Greek minorities"
  POE_greek_minorities_desc:0 "Although Byzantine Empire has fallen, the people of Anatolia have not forgotten their ancestry. There are still a lot of Greeks among us. Sometimes, they're the majority in a province. Often, they're underrepresented. This is no more such a case. The Pontic Greeks shall flourish once more, and never again experience discrimination!"
  POE_jannisary_model:0 "Adopt the Jannisary Model"
  POE_jannisary_model_desc:0 "The Ottomans may look to us as an empire of evil, but they know how to assemble an army. Let us learn from them. We don't wish to adopt slavery, however the idea of professional, lifelong soldier is very appealing. We can afford one of the first professional armies in the world, and let us pioneer the military technology so we mustn't ever fear from our enemies again."
