  remember_the_bruce_desc:0 "Robert I the Bruce led a fierce rebellion against Edward I, tyrant of England. It is believed he saw a spider in his prison cell try to anchor its web six time, and succeeded only after 7 tries. Seeing this as an omen, he saw this as a sign to continue his struggle against the English. In 1314, he won against the English and became King of Scotland until 1329. Let his memory live on forever in our hearts."
