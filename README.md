## Running this mod

If you wish to play with the most recent changes and patches, it's recommended to run the Github version.

1. Open the Europa Universalis IV Documents directory (where your screenshots, cache and logs are storred), then enter the `mod` folder.
2. Clone the repo like so
`git clone https://github.com/PitiRR/pitirr-eu4-rp-mod.git` or [download](https://github.com/PitiRR/pitirr-eu4-rp-mod/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the zip from Github under the Code section.
1. Unpack `pitirr-eu4-rp-mod.mod` to mod folder, so that both `pitirr-eu4-rp-mod` and `.mod` are children of `Europa Universalis IV/mod`.
2. You will probably need to add the mod to your current playset manually in the EUIV launcher(it will not prompt you to add the mod to current playset at the top).
3. You should be able to select the mod on and off upon adding it to your current playset.

Alternatively, if you wish to play the Production version (released as a Tag, see [Versioning](#versioning)), you can download the item from Steam Workshop ([link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2890580432)).
