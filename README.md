A mod for Europa Universalis IV tailored for multiplayer campaigns in a server I participate in.

## About

## Running this mod

1. Open CMD and move to mod directory in EU4 in your Documents directory.
2. Clone the repo like so
`git clone https://github.com/PitiRR/pitirr-eu4-rp-mod.git`
3. Unpack `pitirr-eu4-rp-mod.mod` one directory above, to /mod directly.
4. You will probably need to add the mod to your current playset manually (launcher will not prompt you to add the mod to current playset at the top)
5. You should be able to select the mod on and off upon adding it to your current playset.
